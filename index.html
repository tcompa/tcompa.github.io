Since October 2013, I am a PhD student in the <a href="">Condensed matter theory group</a> of the Laboratoire de Physique Statistique (École Normale Supérieure, Paris), under the supervision of <a href="">Werner Krauth</a>. I am interested in the field of numerical simulations of condensed matter and cold atomic systems, and in particular I am working on quantum Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations for the unitary Bose gas.
This work is based on some recent research activity in our group, see:</br>
<i>S. Piatecki and W. Krauth, Efimov-driven phase transitions of the unitary Bose gas</i> (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4671">arXiv</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140320/ncomms4503/full/ncomms4503.html">Nature Communications</a>).
