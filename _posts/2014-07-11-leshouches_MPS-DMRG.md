In the end of June, I have taken part to the *4th Les Houches School in computational physics: From quantum gases to strongly correlated systems* ([link][link-school]).
Among many other things, we started working from scratch on a simple MPS/DMRG program; the code (available [here][link-code]) is still waiting to be debugged. Feel free to help!
