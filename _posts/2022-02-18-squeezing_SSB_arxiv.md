Here's one more way to generate scalable spin squeezing with quantum simulators, when they implement a model featuring spontaneous symmetry breaking. In [our new work][link-arxiv], with colleagues from Lyon and Villetaneuse, we show that adding a small magnetic field is all you need to do - see also [here][link-research].
