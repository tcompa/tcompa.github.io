We uploaded a new manuscript on arXiv: *Density-dependent hopping for ultracold atoms immersed in a Bose-Einstein-condensate vortex lattice* ([read it here][link-arxiv]). The numerical optimization of the variational Gutzwiller wave function is performed through Simulated Annealing, and its python/cython implementation is publicly available [on Zenodo][link-zenodo]. Comments are welcome!
