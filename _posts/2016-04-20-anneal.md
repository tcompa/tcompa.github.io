I have released the first version of **anneal**, a simple python implementation of the simulated-annealing optimization algorithm.
It is meant to be general purpose, and can be adapted to several cases from sudoku solvers to model fitting.
Have a look at the code [on github][link-github], comments are welcome!
(the release is also stored [on Zenodo][link-zenodo], with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.50116)
