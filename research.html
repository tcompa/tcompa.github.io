<b>Thermodynamics of the unitary Bose gas</b>
</p>
This is a project based on <b>path-integral quantum Monte Carlo</b> simulations of the thermodynamics of the unitary Bose gas, which is a system of bosons with resonant two-body interactions (i.e. infinite scattering length).
This system has attracted large interest as it allows to observe three-body physics at action in a many-body system, since it has provided the first experimental observation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efimov_state">Efimov effect</a>, predicted in Nuclear Physics in the 1970s.
Following a previous project by Swann Piatecki, I am working on the characterization of the phase diagram and of the <b>phase transitions</b> which exist for a model of this system.

<b>Classical three-body hard-core model</b>
</p>
<a href="http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Hard_disks">Hard disks</a> and <a href="http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Hard_sphere_model">hard spheres</a> are central models in Statistical Mechanics, and also some of the first ones to be treated by numerical methods as Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics.
In a recent study of the unitary Bose gas in our group, the model of choice included a hard cut-off on the three-body distance (that is the root-mean-square distance of a triplet of particles);
now, we have pushed this model to the regime of large temperature and large density, and studied the classical system which only includes this three-body hard-core potential (to be compared with the usual pairwise hard-core repulsion).
We have studied this generalized model in two and three dimensions, and found a <b>liquid-solid transition</b> upon increasing pressure.
The three-body interactions give rise to peculiar structures in the limit of infinite pressure: according to our conjecture, the close-packed structures is a <b>triangular lattice of dimers</b> in two dimensions, while it is a <b>simple-hexagonal</b> lattice of single particles in three dimensions.
Starting from these infinite-pressure structures (which are also found through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">simulated annealing</a>), we used Monte Carlo simulations in the NPT ensemble to measure the finite-pressure phase diagram.
The two-dimensional solid is particularly interesting, since the dimer-dimer effective interaction can be seen at the same time as a frustrated <b>spin-spin coupling</b> (concerning the dimers' orientation) or as a <b>hard-disk repulsion</b> (concerning the dimers' positions).

<b>Inhomogeneous Bose Hubbard model</b>
</p>
Systems of cold atoms in optical lattices are regarded as clean and highly tunable set-ups, in which Condensed Matter models can be realized and studied in an easier way than in the usual solid-state experiments.
A first example of this approach has been the explanation of the <b>superfluid-to-Mott insulator phase transition</b> (which <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6867/abs/415039a.html">was observed</a> in a system of ultracold <sup>87</sup>Rb atoms) through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Hubbard_model">Bose-Hubbard model</a> (bosonic equivalent of the well known Hubbard model).
In our work, we have studied this model in the set-up where the optical lattice is modified by adding an external <b>harmonic potential</b>, as it is often the case in the experimental realizations (although there has been recent progress on the realization of uniform box-shaped potentials, for example see <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.200406">here</a>).
In presence of this external potential, the system becomes inhomogeneous and different domains appear, forming the so-called <b>wedding-cake structure</b> in the density profile.
Our study is mainly based on the <b>Gutzwiller technique</b>, with a sub-project making use of Green's Function Monte Carlo to study the one-dimensional extended Bose Hubbard model.
